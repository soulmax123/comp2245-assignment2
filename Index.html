            <p><strong>EOMM</strong> stands for Engagement Optimized Matchmaking. In Call of Duty and other online games, EOMM is a matchmaking system designed to maximize player engagement rather than just balance skill levels.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
            <p>Instead of only matching players by skill (like traditional SBMMâ€”Skill-Based Matchmaking), EOMM uses data and algorithms to predict which matchups will keep players playing longer. This can mean mixing skill levels, creating varied win/loss streaks, or adjusting match difficulty to maintain player interest.</p>
